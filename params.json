Here's how I did it. You could also just buy one of [these](http://www.amazon.com/WowWee-Rovio-Enabled-Robotic-WebCam/dp/B001CQLGD6), but where is the fun in that. \r\n\r\n## Steps\r\n1. Went on to eBay and bought a Roomba that was listed as broken. Turns out a lot of Roombas breakdown with they symptoms of \"spinning in circles with 9 beeps.\" Easy fix with some new infrared sensors.\r\n2. Had a Dreamplug lying around, its a \"headless\" embedded Linux server.\r\n3. Secure the Dreamplug to the roomba with a 3D printed holder. \r\n4. Add a FTDI USB-Serial connection to send commands to the Roomba and add a DC/DC converter to run the Dreamplug off the Roomba's battery pack.\r\n![alt text](http://bellspringsteen.github.io/RoombaCatStalker/images/pcb.png \"circuit\")\r\n5. Wrote a Django web app to run on the device to display the webcam feed, view the Roomba sensors, and control the Roomba's motion. \r\n\r\nAll this so I can see what the cat is doing when I am gone. (I kind of thought he was putting on clothes and playing cards)\r\n\r\nMaybe things to do in the future:\r\n* Turn image into video capture\r\n* add voice recognition, probably [here](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/sphinx/)\r\n* Camera on 3D axis servo?","google":"UA-43867634-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
